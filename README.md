## Description

In semester project 2, I coded a shoe shop website, which I had designed by hand with Strapi as CMS (Content Management System).

To be able to view content and be able to log in. then the strapi API must take place locally on your PC.
This can be done by following the installation of strapi given below.


## Built With

- [HTML](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/html/)
- [JS](https://devdocs.io/javascript/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)


## Getting Started

### Strapi API Installing

- The Strapi project can be found  [Here](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2)

1. Clone the repo:

Deploy locally\
Install the npm dependencies and then run npm run develop:

npm install\
npm run develop

You can add, edit and delete products in the API and change the Home single type content, but do not add any new properties or endpoints to the API.

If you do want to add custom properties, endpoints or additional functionality you can create your own API which must be publicly hosted. 


User credentials
